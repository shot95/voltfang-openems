== Compatibility
* SolarEdge SE33.3k

== Application Notes

Activating the OpenEMS option dynamicRuntimeScalefactors() delays all SolarEdge channel values by approx. 2 core cycle time.


=== Configuration
Be careful! Solar edge SE33.3k uses dynamic runtime scalefactors. Be sure that you enable
dynamicRuntimeScalefactors() within OpenEMS configuration.

=== Maturity
Production State: *-pilot projects-*
