= RRD4J 

Persists data of OpenEMS Edge Channels to RRD4J files. Only channels with persistence priority at least
as high as the configured persistence priority are stored. One file is created for each channel which 
should be persisted. 

The files are stored in the configured openems.data.dir of the openems-edge service. Cumulated channels
(i.e. energy channels) are stored once every 60 minutes, while the others are stored once every 5 minutes.
In Version 3, each file stores data of the last 450 days, resulting in disk usage of about 85kB
for each cumulated channel and about 1MB for each other channel. As RRD4J is a round robin database,
the size of the files is constant.
