= GMC EM2389

The GMC EM2389 three phase bidirectional LAN Meter for 1A coils.

Implemented Natures:
- ElectricityMeter

== Compatibility 
* GMC EM2389

== Application Notes

Response from GMC: If the coil ratio is 50 (e.g. 250A primary, 5A secondary) the meter
provides data with a resolution of 100W.

If the coil ratio is > 100 (e.g. 250A primary, 1A secondary) the meter
provides data with a resolution of 1000W. In this case, set `config.alternativePowerCalculation() = true`, and the power will be calculated
from voltage and current to obtain a resolution of 230W.
