= Backend Alerting

This Component handles Alerting mechanisms.

Currently Implemented:
 - Offline Alert (send an alerting message, when the Edge is offline)
 - SumState Alert (send an alerting message, when the _sum/State is either Warning or Fault)

== Developer Notes

Regarding SumStateAlerting
The scheduling / Alerting mechanism only works, as long the Edge is online.

When the Event Edge.OnSetSumState gets triggered (either on _sum/State update or every ~5 min),
the SumStateHandlers "handleEdgeOnSetOnline" gets called.
If the SumState is severe (Warning or Fault) the "addOrUpdate" Method gets called.
If the State changes from warning to fault, or from fault to warning the time stamp of the scheduled message gets updated.
Should the Edge toggle between those two state no notification mail gets send. Keep this in mind.
