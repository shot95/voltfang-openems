= PV-Inverter Cluster

Combines multiple PV-Inverters to one common PV-Inverter. This way every Controller can easily work with multiple PV-Inverters in parallel.

If masterMode() is false, the specified power is distributed evenly across all PV inverters.
It is possible to operate PV inverters with different maximum output power.
If the average power to be distributed is greater than the maximum power of a "small"
PV inverter, the more powerful neighbor takes over the missing differential power.
When masterMode() is activated, the power to distribute is passed to one configured master.


## Implementation details

TODO switch to OSGI Component
