= Microcare SDM 630 Meter

This implementation is functionally compatible with a number of energy meters with the name "SDM 630" and other whitelabel products.

== Implemented Natures

* ElectricityMeter

== Compatibility

* Microcare SDM 630
* Eastron SDM 630
* Controlin SDK-005
* Controlin SDK-103
* Controlin SDK-100


== Application Notes
=== Configuration

Default Modbus Unit ID: 1

Modbus Parameter: 9600/8/N/1 or 19200/8/N/1

If there are 10 such meters on one Modbus RTU bridge, the communication will be very slow. In this case, activate
the meter with `config.reducedReading()=true`. Only the most relevant registers will be read out then to save time.

=== Maturity
Production State: *-pilot projects-*
